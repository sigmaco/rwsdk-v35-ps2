 *  \ingroup commbuilder  
 *
 *  This class is an abstract base class that is responsible for building the scene graph. 
 *  The process of building a scene graph involves translating native specific objects to
 *  RwComm scene graph objects. Each specific modeling tool builder traverses its native
 *  scene graph, and for each object it encounters, creates the appropriate RwComm scene
 *  graph element.
 *
 *  The mapping from the native element to the RwComm element is achieved via an extendable
 *  mapping table, implemented in the derived classes. Each entry in the table holds a mapping from
 *  the native object type to a RwCommObjCreator class instance. The RwCommObjCreator object,
 *  creates the appropriate RwComm element. Each specific modeling tool builder is constructed with a
 *  default set of RwCommObjCreator objects. The user can always override this default set, by
 *  registering his own set of RwCommObjCreator objects within the builder, and thus
 *  changing the way the scene graph is constructed.
 *
 *  \see RwCommObjCreator
