       DYNAMIC LINK LIBRARY : MaxSimple
========================================================================

This is an example of how to write your own custom builder and export
application. To demonstrate this we used a simplified 3dsmax exporter. Please note that
this implementation is different from the original RwMax implemntation, and contains only
a small subset of the RwMax export features.

Compiling
---------
Change the include directory to point to your installed maxsdk/include directory.
Change the output file path to point to your installed max plugin directory. 

Running
-------
From the Max File -> Export menu, choose export to an RWS file. Specify the rws file to export to
and press the Save button.


About the Example
-----------------

MaxSimpleExp Class - This is the main export application class. The class simply calls the 
ExportManager::Export() method, passing is a single asset. (See the MaxSimpleExp::DoExport() method).
The asset we created for this example is a dummy asset class, which only holds the asset template name.
We assign a "Static World" template to the asset, which causes the export manager to perform a BSP export.

MaxSimpleBuilder Class - This is a simplified version of the RwMaxBuilder class. The class holds a lookup
table, mapping Max SuperClassIDs to RwCommObjCreator objects. The builder traverses the Max scene and 
attempts to build each Max object it encounters, using the lookup table. For this example we've implemented
three RwCommObject classes : MaxSimpleTransform, MaxSimpleMesh and MaxSimpleShader. All these classes are
registered by default in the MaxSimpleBuilder. (They are registered in the class' constructor).
An instance of the MaxSimpleBuilder class is attached to the export manager, so that each time we call the
RwExpMgrExportmanager::Export() method, our own custom scene graph is built using our builder.
